# ispyb-openapi
OpenAPI specifications for ISPyB and SynchWeb web services

## ISPyB
ISPyB OpenAPI spec was auto-generated from the Java JAXRS annotations. Changes to the ISPyB code needed are included in my openapi branch of the ISPyB code

The annotations list almost all parameters correctly. 

Some manual effort will be required to correctly specify the Content-type for the POST requests (see authenticate for an example).

## SynchWeb
Manually created on a module basis
